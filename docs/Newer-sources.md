Here's the honest picture of what's actually new vs what's just recycled:
The real situation with WFC in 2025
The core WFC algorithm hasn't fundamentally changed — it's a solved problem. What HAS evolved is how people combine it with other systems and how they solve its biggest weakness: infinite worlds without contradictions.
The genuinely newer and better stuff:
Nested WFC (2024) — this is the most exciting recent development. It won Best Paper at IEEE Conference on Games and supports deterministic, aperiodic, infinite content generation without backtracking due to conflicts. Nyh-dolphin This directly solves the problem ndwfc struggled with. The paper is from NYU's Game Innovation Lab and they published working experiments in Super Mario Bros and Carcassonne. This is worth reading: https://nyh-dolphin.github.io/en/research/n_wfc/
Chunked Hierarchical WFC (2024) — a paper specifically about generating large synthetic worlds in chunks, which is exactly what you need for an infinite Phaser world. Published at the International Conference on Image and Vision Computing in December 2024. ACM Other conferences
WFC + Genetic Algorithms (2025) — a hybrid approach combining WFC with genetic algorithms for level generation, published in Lecture Notes in Computer Science in 2025. EurekaMag Basically using evolution to guide WFC's decisions — more controllable output.
The honest trade-off with ndwfc specifically
The reason ndwfc still gets referenced despite being old is that its infinite canvas concept was ahead of its time. But the core limitation remains: in rare cases during infinite generation, the slot the player is currently in gets regenerated, which makes pure WFC for infinite worlds unsuitable for commercial games.

What this means for your project
For a Phaser.js game right now, the most pragmatic approach is actually to not use WFC for infinite generation and instead use it only for finite chunks — generate a 50x50 chunk with WFC, then stitch chunks together using noise-based biome seeding. That way you get WFC's beautiful local coherence without hitting its infinite-world contradiction problem.
The ndwfc repo actually has a recent fork — ivan-kravets/wfc-js-2d-3d — that's essentially a maintained JS version of the same idea, worth checking out over the original.
Want me to update the PRD to reflect this hybrid approach? Or would you rather just start building and figure it out as we go?
